I am Xingyu DENG (邓星宇), a PhD candidate at the University of Sheffield, supervised by [Dr Mark Stevenson](https://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/m.stevenson/). My current research interest is about fact checking tasks in scientific domains, specifically in healthcare. With the rise of the Internet, individuals increasingly rely on online information to guide their healthcare decision-making. However, the vast amount of information available online can often be misleading and result in confusion and poor health outcomes. The fact checking system aims to use machine learning to design robust public health interventions that mitigate health inequalities.

Prior to Sheffield, I completed my undergraduate and master's degrees at the University of Manchester. My master's project is developing a healthcare fact checking system, supervised by [Prof Goran Nenadic](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/gnenadic/). My undergraduate project is transferring Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) into classic ANN tasks to analyse SNN's potentials, which is experimenting based on the [SpiNNaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpiNNaker), supervised by [Prof Steve Furber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Furber).
